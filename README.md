the multiple-line chart  is able to show  total fare by the city over Jan to May 5 months we can see an increase during the month of April and  ,The number of rides seems not stable  at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March  
The end of Feb is the peek there is a relationship between city population and the total number of rides and total drivers , we can notice the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase in urban areas and suburban areas ,another fact  in rural areas fewer drivers   lead to a higher average fare per ride  
it is related to  the accessibility for (the internet connection ) and the public transportation on that areas

## Summary
First of all , We can see an  increase during the month of April in suburban cities, and  the total fare decreases for other types of cities
Furthermore the average fare per ride shows an increase from more populated cites to less populated cities.
This type of  information helps the  company addressing the reasons behind these data and fixing it , by limiting or increasing the number of drivers during a certain time . and we can notice the less number of  rides is the reason behind less drivers and making average fare per ride more expensive
This  data set is so important for  the company in making more profit and managing  rush hours in hiring new drivers and also addressing the problem of why in rural areas
total rides are minumum .?
